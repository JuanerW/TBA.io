            <h2>What is Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
            <p>The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, is a time management tool that helps
                individuals prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. Named after President Dwight D.
                Eisenhower, it divides tasks into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent
                but not important, and neither urgent nor important. This method aids in focusing on tasks that
                contribute to long-term goals while managing immediate demands effectively.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>How We Apply the Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
            <p>Our application integrates the Eisenhower Matrix to help users efficiently manage their tasks. Users can
                categorize their tasks into the four quadrants of the matrix, enabling them to prioritize effectively.
                Below is an explanation and example for each of the four categories:</p>

            <h3>1. Urgent and Important</h3>
            <p>This category is for tasks that require immediate attention and are crucial to your goals. These tasks
                often have tight deadlines and significant consequences if not completed promptly. They should be
                prioritized and dealt with as soon as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Completing a client project due by the end of the day, or preparing for an
                urgent meeting with a key stakeholder.</p>

            <h3>2. Important but Not Urgent</h3>
            <p>Tasks in this category are important for your long-term success but do not require immediate action.
                These tasks should be scheduled and planned in advance to prevent them from becoming urgent. Focusing on
                these tasks can lead to greater achievements over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Strategic planning for the next quarter, skill development, or working on a
                long-term project.</p>

            <h3>3. Urgent but Not Important</h3>
            <p>This category includes tasks that demand immediate attention but are not critical to your overall goals.
                These tasks can often be delegated to others, allowing you to focus on more important activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Responding to a non-critical email, attending a meeting that could be handled
                by someone else, or dealing with minor technical issues.</p>

            <h3>4. Not Urgent and Not Important</h3>
            <p>Tasks that fall into this category are neither time-sensitive nor critical to your goals. They can often
                be eliminated or postponed indefinitely to free up time for more valuable activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Excessive social media browsing, watching non-informative videos, or engaging
                in tasks that do not contribute to your goals.</p>

            <p>By categorizing tasks into these four quadrants, our application helps you focus on what truly matters,
                improving your productivity and ensuring that you are always working towards your most important goals.
            </p>

            <h2>Benefits of Using Our Application</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Focus:</strong> By categorizing tasks according to urgency and importance, users
                    can concentrate on what truly matters, minimizing distractions.</li>
                <li><strong>Better Time Management:</strong> The Eisenhower Matrix helps users allocate their time more
                    effectively, ensuring that critical tasks are completed on time.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Organization:</strong> Users can easily organize tasks into different categories,
                    making it simpler to manage workloads and deadlines.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal Achievement:</strong> By focusing on important tasks, users are more likely to achieve
                    their long-term goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Stress Reduction:</strong> Prioritizing tasks helps reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed,
                    leading to a more manageable and less stressful work experience.</li>
