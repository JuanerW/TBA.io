            <h2>About Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
            <p>The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, is a time management tool that helps individuals prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. Named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, it divides tasks into four quadrants: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important. This method aids in focusing on tasks that contribute to long-term goals while managing immediate demands effectively.</p>
